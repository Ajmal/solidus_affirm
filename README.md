# SolidusAffirm

Introduction goes here.

## Installation

Add solidus_affirm to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_affirm'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_affirm:install
```
## Configuration

To generate the correct URL's in the JSON payload we need to specify the
`default_url_options` for the Solidus engine. You can do that like this:

```
Spree::Core::Engine.routes.default_url_options = {
  host: 'example.com'
}
```

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_affirm/factories'
```
